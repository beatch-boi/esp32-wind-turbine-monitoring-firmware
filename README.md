# ESP32 Wind Turbine Monitoring Firmware

This repository contains prototype firmware for an ESP32-based wind turbine monitoring system.

## About

This project is a proof-of-concept prototype designed to monitor key wind turbine parameters:
- **Blade rotation speed**
- **Motor rotation speed**
- **Three-phase current generated by the turbine**

The firmware reads sensor data, calculates RPM and current values, and serves them via a simple web interface using WebSockets.

## Features

- Reads blade and motor rotation speeds using AS5600 magnetic encoders over I2C.
- Measures three-phase current using ACS712 sensors and the ESP32 ADC.
- Hosts a Wi-Fi Access Point and HTTP/WebSocket server for real-time data display.
- Simple web dashboard for live monitoring.

## Disclaimer

This is prototype code for demonstration and testing
